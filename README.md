# Install

1) Backup/rename (!) your previous .vim folder and vimrc files.

2) Then just install full package (including all plugins):

```zsh
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/kajamite/vim.git ~/.vim
```

If you need more information about every plugin, read their README docs
in corresponding folders in ~/.vim/bundle folder.


Enjoy!
