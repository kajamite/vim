# Install

Backup/rename (!) your previous .vim folder and vimrc files.

Then just install full package:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/kajamite/vim.git ~/.vim


If you need more information about every plugin, read their README docs
in corresponding folders in ~/.vim/bundle folder.


Enjoy!
