# Install

My ready to go VIM package for quick setup on new machines.

This package is ruby/rails oriented with monokai2 theme by default.

1. Backup/rename (!) your previous .vim folder and vimrc files.

2. Then just install full package (including all plugins):

```zsh
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/kajamite/vim.git ~/.vim
```

If you need more information about every plugin, read their README docs
in corresponding folders in ~/.vim/bundle folder.

3. You will need to additionaly configure YouCompleteMe plugin (if you plan to use it). Read more about it [here](http://valloric.github.io/YouCompleteMe/).

### Enjoy!
